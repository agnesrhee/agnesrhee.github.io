COME ON!!! You know Salad!!!!!! But if you really want to know...
<h2>Her humble beginning</h2>
<p>Salad was born November 13, 2020 (I picked the day). Her past is vague but she had a bad first owner! :( 
She was an indoor outdoor cat but her owner didn't want to spend the extra money to spay her so she came back one day pregnant!!
The owner didn't want kitties so they sent Salad and her babies off to a high kill shelter... Luckily, this cat rescue picked her and her kids up
hours before they were about to get put down!!! Her babies were named Chicken, Macaroni, Tuna, and Potato. Thankfully, they all got adopted and I adopted sweet
Salad on October 20, 2021!! Now she is spoiled and loved by many!!</p>

<h2>Name origin</h2>
<p>Salad was her original shelter name! Thomas wanted a dog but saw how cute Salad was and how much I wanted her so he agreed ONLY IF I kept her shelter name.
While I know I could have changed it, Salad ended up sticking and I feel like she can't be anything else BUT Salad.</p>
