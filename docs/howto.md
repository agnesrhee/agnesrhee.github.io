<h2>Infos</h2>
If you've never used a Genie litter can, here's a tutorial:

This is for dumping the litter! A whole bag can be put in the main trash can.

Salad's vet info:

Phone number: 804-308-8920<br>
I will have a carrier out for quick access! Only for emergencies, so I hope you never have to use it!

You should at least have my number so I won't post it haha. We'll be 12 hours ahead of you so it might be hard to get in touch ASAP but I'll be on the lookout and you should be able to text or call if needed. 

<h3>Concerning Salad's sleep thing</h3>
<p>If you don't know, she has a sleeping pee issue (otherwise perfectly healthy). She'll fall asleep deeply and start jerking around in her sleep and then pee. It most likely won't happen when you're there, but if it does happen, pleeeeeease gently wake her up (you can shake her or pick her up) or be prepared to spray her pee spot with cleaner. :( THANK U </p>

<h3>Salad's fav things</h3>
<p>She prefers loving and petting over playing but she loves her heating pad (it'll be out) and she also loves having her little toys thrown at her for her to chase. Sometimes even her little pink fluffy wand!! Toys will be on the dining table. She'll just wanna hang out with you though!</p>

<h2>Whereabouts</h2>
<b>Salad's room -</b> in the hallway on the left side at the end!! Her room has her bed, dry food autofeeder, litter box, and extras.<br>
<b>Garbage can - </b> On the outside of the house there's a small wooden gate to the backyard. Trash can and recycle bin are there!<br>
<b>Garbage bags - </b> Under the kitchen sink<br>
<b>Cleaning stuff -</b> There is a bottle called angry orange and it'll be next to the paper towels in the kitchen. <br>
<b>Carrier -</b> In Salad's room holding the extra stuff, such as extra genie litter bags and litter. <br>
<b>Purple air tag collar -</b> In the container by the back door, it has an air tag and a bell. <br>
